Hello Ben! Thank you for contacting Virgin Media Sales Webchat, how may I assist you?
Great to hear you're interested in Virgin Media Services, Ben. Can I take your postcode and house number please so we can start?
Thanks! Whilst I'm checking your postcode, may I ask what made you decide to choose Virgin Media as your service provider?
Thanks for looking into our services; our cables aren’t with you yet. We’re still about to bring superfast broadband to your area!
That's where you come in. Register your interest on the link below which will help speed the process up :)
The more registrations your community gets, the more likely we are to connect you! Rest assured we’re working as fast as we can to get to you.
yes that's correct.
Upon checking here we are unable to provide TV, broadband and phone in your property yet.
If you register your address online we can send you updates when you will get our services. :)
